See [`README.md`](README.md) for more details, including how to originate the oracle contract.

This tutorial explains how to originate and use the signed admin contract
to administer the oracle.

Instead of the admin having the only address that can make changes, any address
can send a transaction with an update signed by an admin _key_.

## Originating the admin contract

```bash
❯❯❯ alpha-client --wait none originate contract NatOracleSignedAdmin \
  transferring 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS running \
  "$(./stack exec -- lorentz-contract-oracle Signed print --value-typeType "nat" --oneline)" \
  --init "$(./stack exec -- lorentz-contract-oracle Signed init \
  --oracleContract $ORACLE_ADDRESS \
  --admin "$(get_public_key alice)")" --burn-cap 0.938

New contract KT1UvdRG22BE96VJMfECHn5uEtjGFWsKV1BU originated.
Contract memorized as NatOracleSignedAdmin.
```

Then make a `bash` alias for the contract:

```bash
SIGNED_ADMIN_ADDRESS="KT1UvdRG22BE96VJMfECHn5uEtjGFWsKV1BU"
```

## Set the oracle's admin to the new contract

You'll need an oracle contract that stores `nat` values:
see [`README.md`](README.md) for more details.

Once you have the oracle contract's address set to `ORACLE_ADDRESS`,
update the oracle to be administered by the new admin contract:

```bash
❯❯❯ alpha-client --wait none transfer 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS to $ORACLE_ADDRESS \
  --arg "$(./stack exec -- lorentz-contract-oracle Oracle update-admin \
  --admin $SIGNED_ADMIN_ADDRESS)" --burn-cap 0.000001

## Updating the oracle value

If you want to sign the Michelson value without the CLI tool, elide a secret key:

```bash
❯❯❯ ./stack exec -- lorentz-contract-oracle SignedAdmin update-value --newValueType "nat" --newValue 7 
Left (Left 7)
```

Otherwise, you'll need to provide the current counter and secret key:

```bash
❯❯❯ ./stack exec -- lorentz-contract-oracle SignedAdmin update-value --newValueType "nat" --newValue 7 --counter 0 --secretKey "$(get_secret_key alice)"
Pair "edsigtm7116sRJH8S3PW8N2TxJinC9cP3LmEKn7DZ1wJzQxaqHo6gZq9cCvRgTJzHKA2XxoqnkJjZMjkefPMk523Hn5dhhLUZJQ" (Pair 0 (Left (Left 7)))
```

To update the value (assuming you provide the secret key directly):

```bash
❯❯❯ alpha-client --wait none transfer 0 from $ALICE_ADDRESS to $SIGNED_ADMIN_ADDRESS \
  --arg "$(./stack exec -- lorentz-contract-oracle SignedAdmin update-value \
  --newValueType "nat" \
  --newValue 7 \
  --counter 0 \
  --secretKey "$(get_secret_key alice)")" --burn-cap 0.000001
